      <p className="text-justify pb-3">
        Deep within the Pixeru-verse (ピクセル界), there lived a legendary
        shinobi known as Kaku-shi, named for his perfectly square form. His
        distinctive appearance – a shadowy body marked by a crimson hachimaki
        and stark white eyes – made him instantly recognizable among the digital
        dojo's finest warriors. While other ninja of the Noun-clan practiced
        traditional ninjutsu, Kaku-shi developed his own martial art called
        "Pixel-jutsu," which embraced the ancient ways of right-angled movement
        and block-based stealth.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify pb-3">
        When the dreaded Namakura-dan (なまくら団), a gang of curved-edge
        bandits, threatened to steal the sacred Genesis Pixeru from the
        Kabuki-cho district's central temple, Kaku-shi knew he must defend his
        realm's angular honor. The bandits, led by their boss Smooth-sama,
        mocked Kaku-shi's blocky movements, believing their rounded edges and
        anti-aliasing techniques would prove superior to his rigid style. But as
        they reached for the sacred artifact, Kaku-shi unleashed his ultimate
        technique: "八ビットの術" (Eight-Bit Style: Infinite Pixel Flash).
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify pb-3">
        The battle concluded in a dazzling display of pixelated energy, with the
        Namakura-dan defeated and transformed into perfectly aligned blocks.
        From that day forward, Kaku-shi's teachings spread throughout the
        digital dojos of the Pixeru-verse, inspiring young shinobi to embrace
        their blocky nature. Atop the temple steps, his hachimaki swaying in the
        digital wind (animated in three perfect frames), he shared the wisdom of
        his ancestors: "道は四角い" (The Way is Square).
